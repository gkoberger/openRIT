          RIT has begun to roll out parts of its new geneSIS project, which is built on PeopleSoft. We can't replace the entire system, however we can build a useable UI for discovering classes. We can make finding awesome classes and building the perfect schedule as simple as it should be.

      <h3>What is the goal of openRIT?</h3>
      <p>The goal of openRIT is to make awesome software that improves student and faculty life at RIT.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <h3>I work at RIT. How can I help?</h3>
      <p>Students can't do it alone. If you can help us with finding course credit, money or mentorship, please <a href="mailto:gkoberger@gmail.com">contact us!</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <h3>How will projects be set up?</h3>
      <p>Each project will be split up into smaller parts, and each part will have a module owner. The module owner will guide the development and design of
      their part of the project. Code will be hosted on GitHub. All code must be reviewed by a peer before being committed. We will have a bug tracker and forum
      set up for discussion.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <h3>I have an idea for a project!</h3>
      <p>We are going to start with one project, and slowly add new projects. We will have a way for people to suggest projects and vote on their favorites.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <h3>Can I get course credit?</h3>
      <p>It's too soon to know if it's possible, however we are going to try to figure out a way to give course credit for contributing to openRIT.</p>
